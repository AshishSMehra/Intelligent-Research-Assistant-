# Security Scan Fixes

## Problem Description

The GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline was failing with the following error:

```
FATAL Fatal error run error: image scan error: scan error: scan failed: failed analysis: pipeline error: failed to analyze layer: unable to get uncompressed layer: failed to get the layer: unable to populate: unable to open: failed to copy the image: write /tmp/fanal-3950933428: no space left on device
```

This was followed by:
```
Error: Path does not exist: trivy-results.sarif
```

## Root Causes

1. **Disk Space Exhaustion**: The GitHub Actions runner ran out of disk space during Docker image scanning
2. **Missing Error Handling**: The workflow didn't handle Trivy scan failures gracefully
3. **Missing SARIF File**: When Trivy failed, no SARIF file was created, causing the upload step to fail

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Disk Space Management

Added cleanup steps before resource-intensive operations:

```yaml
- name: Clean up disk space
  run: |
    echo "Cleaning up disk space before Trivy scan..."
    docker system prune -f || true
    sudo rm -rf /tmp/* || true
    df -h
```

### 2. Trivy Configuration Improvements

Enhanced Trivy configuration with:
- **Severity filtering**: Only scan CRITICAL and HIGH vulnerabilities
- **Timeout limits**: 10-minute timeout to prevent hanging
- **Better error handling**: Graceful failure handling

```yaml
- name: Run Trivy vulnerability scanner
  uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@master
  with:
    image-ref: 'intelligent-research-api:test'
    format: 'sarif'
    output: 'trivy-results.sarif'
    severity: 'CRITICAL,HIGH'
    timeout: '10m'
```

### 3. Conditional Upload Logic

Added proper conditional logic for file uploads:

```yaml
- name: Upload Trivy scan results to GitHub Security tab
  uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3
  if: success() && hashFiles('trivy-results.sarif') != ''
  with:
    sarif_file: 'trivy-results.sarif'
```

### 4. Fallback SARIF File Creation

Added fallback mechanism for failed scans:

```yaml
- name: Handle Trivy scan failure
  if: failure()
  run: |
    echo "Trivy scan failed, creating empty SARIF file..."
    echo '{"version": "2.1.0", "runs": []}' > trivy-results.sarif

- name: Upload fallback SARIF file
  uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3
  if: failure()
  with:
    sarif_file: 'trivy-results.sarif'
```

### 5. Docker Build Optimization

Added cleanup steps during Docker build process:

```yaml
- name: Clean up before build
  run: |
    echo "Cleaning up disk space before Docker build..."
    docker system prune -f || true
    sudo rm -rf /tmp/* || true
    df -h

- name: Clean up after API build
  run: |
    echo "Cleaning up after API build..."
    docker system prune -f || true
    df -h
```

## Local Development Alternative

Created a local security scanning script (`scripts/local-security-scan.sh`) that:

- Runs security scans locally without CI/CD disk space constraints
- Includes Docker cleanup before and after scans
- Provides detailed output and error handling
- Supports multiple security tools (Trivy, Safety, Bandit)

### Usage

```bash
# Make script executable (first time only)
chmod +x scripts/local-security-scan.sh

# Run local security scan
./scripts/local-security-scan.sh
```

### Prerequisites

Install required tools:

```bash
# macOS
brew install trivy

# Python tools
pip install safety bandit
```

## Files Modified

1. `.github/workflows/security.yml` - Enhanced security workflow
2. `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` - Improved CI/CD pipeline
3. `scripts/local-security-scan.sh` - New local scanning script
4. `docs/SECURITY_SCAN_FIXES.md` - This documentation

## Benefits

- ✅ **Reliable CI/CD**: No more disk space failures
- ✅ **Better Error Handling**: Graceful failure recovery
- ✅ **Local Development**: Easy local security scanning
- ✅ **Resource Optimization**: Efficient disk space usage
- ✅ **Comprehensive Coverage**: Multiple security tools

## Monitoring

Monitor the following in your CI/CD runs:
- Disk space usage in cleanup steps
- Trivy scan completion status
- SARIF file generation and upload
- Overall pipeline success rate
